                <p>Bantayan Island is a small island off the coast of northern Cebu. Don’t be fooled by this sleepy fishing village, the beaches of this humble island exude the same charm and beauty as the famous Boracay Island.

                    The best part is, Bantayan Island is not as commercialized and crowded as Boracay. If you want a relaxing vacation by the beach and witness one of the most beautiful sunsets, Bantayan Island won’t disappoint you. Bantayan Island is blessed with several sprawling white-sand beaches and calm azure waters. Most of the beaches in Bantayan Island are within resorts or owned privately, but they are accessible to the public for a small fee. They are some of the best tourist spots on Bantayan Island. Bantayan Island's Kota Beach is one of the best beaches in the Philippines. It features a sandbar and a lagoon that makes a perfect spot for wading in and sunbathing. Paradise Beach, on the other hand, is a serene stretch of white sand beach that features beautiful rock formations. 

                    Bantayan Island also boasts two natural cave pools, the Ogtong Cave and the Sto. Niño Cave. A natural cold spring feeds both caves, so you can expect chilly water that's great for cooling off after a morning of beach-hopping.<br> <hr><br>A canyoneering tour to Kawasan Falls is an exhilarating water adventure that takes you through towering gorges and stalactite boulders. You get to swim and rappel through the river canyons and even jump off 30-foot-high cliffs into blue pools. The final leg is the third and top tier of Kawasan Falls, also known as Kabukalan Spring, from where the water flows. Canyoneering is one of the best rainy season activities in the Philippines but it can be enjoyed all year round. </p>

            <embed type="video/webm" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pVS8hk6wY4o" class="map1">
                <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d15724.983370833097!2d124.13967560000002!3d9.8297078!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x33aa3da1a65d72f7%3A0xd89c856a3307dd67!2sChocolate%20Hills!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sph!4v1708220940759!5m2!1sen!2sph" class="map1"></iframe>
                <p>Located on the island of Bohol in the Philippines, the Chocolate Hills are a slight mystery to locals and visitors alike. Sometimes called the "Eighth Wonder of the World," the Chocolate Hills are the Philippines' third National Geological Monument, established in 1988, and even appear on Bohol's local flag.

                    The attraction is exactly what it sounds like: rounded hills located at the center of the tiny island that go brown in color during the dry season so they end up looking like giant chocolate truffles.
                    
                    Geologists categorize the landforms as "conical karst topography." Layman's terms: these hills are leftover limestone deposits from a time when streams and rivers were far above sea level. Rainfall and other natural water sources slowly created the dips and valleys the island has become so famous for.<br> <hr><br> For the sake of folklore and everything fun, there are a few other ideas on how this area came to be. One local legend says the hills are the aftermath of a fight between two giants who spent days hurling stones at each other before finally giving up. Another idea states that the hills are the tears of a giant grieving the death of a mortal woman he had fallen in love with.

                    The Chocolate Hills are not very high, ranging from 100 feet to just 165 feet high — though the largest recorded is around 395 feet tall. However, they cover about 20 square miles and can be seen from the towns of Batuan, Sagbayan, Bilar, and Carmen.
                    
                    The hills are most easily accessed from a two-hour ferry ride from Cebu to Tagbilaran, the capital of Bohol. You can also fly into Bohol-Panglao Airport from Manila, or travel to the island by boat from Manila, Siquijor, and various other ports of call.</p>

                    <div class="text">
                        <p><br><br><br>Calamay is a sticky and sweet delicacy. It is made of glutinous rice, coconut milk, and palm or brown sugar. Local guides say that the best calamay in Bohol can be found in the town of Jagna. Calamay is traditionally sold inside smooth coconut shells tied together with strips of red crepe paper. But you can also buy them in small plastic tubs for convenience. Book a Jagna calamay tour from the Bohol Tourism Office to discover how the Boholano pasalubong (gift from your travel destination) is lovingly made. Calamay sells for at least 100 PHP a piece.<br><br><br><hr><br><br><br><br>Broas (ladyfingers) are a popular sweet biscuit among Filipinos. However, not many know that some of the tastiest broas can be found in Baclayon. In a 2016 feature, the Philippine Daily Inquirer mentions that behind the famed Baclayon church is a row of pastry shops selling broas. Unlike the versions found in malls or gift shops, Baclayon broas are “light, sweet, crisp, and melt in the mouth.” Our illustrative photo of neatly fashioned ladyfingers does not do justice to the rougher Baclayon version. Can’t decide on which brand to buy? Osang’s pioneered the selling of broas in the 1800s and is the shop favored by foodies. It’s sold for about 100 PHP for a massive pack of 100 pieces.

                            It is natively known as “Sinilihan” because it is made with lots of long chilies that will make you think it is the only main ingredient. Actually, it is made with pork, “balaw” or shrimp paste, and “gata” or coconut milk. <br><br><br><br><br><hr><br><br><br>Kinunot is another traditional Bicolano dish made with a combination of stingray or shark meat, coconut milk, malunggay or moringa, onions, garlic, and of course hot chilies.
